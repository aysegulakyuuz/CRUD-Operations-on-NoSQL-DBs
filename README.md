# CRUD-Operations-on-NoSQL-DBs

Introduction.
In this report, I will describe an experimental comparison of CRUD operations between two
different NoSQL databases: MongoDB Atlas, and Neo4j. The goal here is to showcase the
performance time comparisons for these types of operations in different environments, along with
their respective efficiencies.
This study relied on two Virtual Machines using Ubuntu and Kali Linux operating systems using
VirtualBox.
NoSQL database systems are commonly used to process huge-scale unstructured or semistructured data. MongoDB is document-based storage database while Neo4j is Graph database.
This experiment measures the performance of each database when executing common CRUD
operations and explores the benefits and limitations of each approach.
